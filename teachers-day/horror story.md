# **The Night School**

## _The Beginning_

Hi! I'm Apple and I've just moved into the school hostel! Today will be my first night here and so far the day has been great! 
My neighbours and teacher-in-charge, Ms Lim have all been very nice to me. I can't wait to start anew in my new home!
Everyone warns me about not leaving my room after 10pm, I wonder why.

### _Discoveries_ 

Tick tock, the clock strikes 10 and I can't go out. 
I sit in my room looking out of the window at the night sky. Dark clouds swirled in the sky. 
Many questions formed in my mind. _Why can't I go out? What could be so dangerous out there? This is a school! Shouldn't there not be anything happening at night?
