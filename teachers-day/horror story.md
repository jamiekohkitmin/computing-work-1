# **The Night School**

## _The Beginning_

Hi! I'm Apple and I've just moved into the school hostel! Today will be my first night here and so far the day has been great! 
My neighbours and teacher-in-charge, Ms Lim have all been very nice to me. I can't wait to start anew in my new home!
Everyone repeatedly warns me about not leaving my room after 10pm, I wonder why.

### _Discoveries_ 

Tick tock, the clock strikes 10 and I can't go out. 
I sit in my room looking out of the window at the night sky. Dark clouds swirled in the sky. 
Many questions formed in my mind. _Why can't I go out? What could be so dangerous out there? This is a school! Shouldn't there not be anything happening at night?
I could no longer sit still. I put on my cute sunflower slippers and sneaked out of my room. When I reached the ground level, I slowly sneaked out of the hostel and into the school. Everything was pitch black, I could only smell milo from the drink stall.  
First, I explored the senior high block and the canteen but I spotted nothing suspicious.
Second, I explored the Y3 and Y4 block but similarly, nothing was there.
As I walked towards the Y1 and Y2 block, I heard shouting coming from the third level. I quickly grabbed a leftover cookie from the cafe to defend myself. When I reached level 3, I crept towards the classroom. Turns out, the sounds were coming from the 1C classroom. The windows were open so any little movement could be seen. I knew I had to be careful.
I hid behind the big red back door. I took a peek and saw people in black robes who looked like they were fighting. When the leader, who could be differentiated by a big black hat, turned around, our eyes met and my jaw dropped...
